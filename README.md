# hello-world
This is a training repository
I am learning how to use Git Hub. This excercise is focused on learning to use branches and main. How to use commits and pulls etc
Now I will add more stuff to see if, this can be added into main brach. 
I think I am getting the hang of it. Who knows, I mights even get good at it?
